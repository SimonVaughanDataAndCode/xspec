xspec scripts

This page gives XSPEC (and shell) scripts for performing Monte Carlo tests within XSPEC. They were written 2005-2006, tested using XSPEC v12.2.1ao running under Scientific Linux 4.2. They have not been maintained since then. I offer no guarantee they will work on other systems.

* source.pha - The "real" dataset for the worked example
* xmmpn.rmf - The response matrix for the data
* xmmpn.arf - The ancillary response file for the data
* sim-rand.xcm - XSPEC script to produce simulated spectra
* groupall - Bash script to run GRPPHA over all simulated spectra
* fit.xcm - XSPEC script to fit all (grouped) simulated spectra

Read the [mc.ps](mc.ps} file for my (circa 2006) explanation.
